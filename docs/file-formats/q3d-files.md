# .q3d files

.q3d files are **Quest3D Project files**.

## Information

Unlike .qpf files, .q3d files **cannot be opened with the Quest3D editor**. They serve as an entry point to a published project and are meant to be opened with the Quest3D Viewer. 

## Format

**Not a lot is known about this so far, contributions are appreciated.**

Like [.cgr files](cgr-files.md), they support compression and contain the string ``ACTF`` at the beginning of the file.
