Information They store channel graphs, images/textures, 3D models and audio and are vital for games to function. It's also possible to load a .cgr file from disk or download one from a server and load it at runtime. This is utilized by Audiosurf during loading and to download songs for Audiosurf Radio. Optionally, .cgr files can be compressed (this feature uses the LZMA compression algorithm ) and protected, preventing them from being opened in the Quest3D editor. However, this is easily bypassed by using Quest3DTamperer . As of now, the only tool that is able to extract files from a .cgr file is Ravioli Game Tools , but it only works with Audiosurf Radio songs. Format Not a lot is known about this so far, contributions are appreciated.
